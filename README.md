# Efficient Normalized Reduction and Generation of Equivalent Multivariate Binary Polynomials

This repository contains a dummy implementation of the NormalizePolynomial and EquivalentPolynomial algorithms described in the NDSS2024 paper [Efficient Normalized Reduction and Generation of Equivalent Multivariate Binary Polynomials](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/auto-draft-436/) for univariate and multivariate binary polynomials.
